Shell Script to Configure Monitor Mode on Unifi-AP-AC-PRO 5ghz

Currently In working progress hope to finish soon. 
The script is designed to connect to the  
UNIFI AP AC Pro router via ssh and force it into monitor 
mode that will dump to your local Wireshark to be able to view the packets. 


UPDATE:

I have now rewrote the scirpt in Batch as a .bat file, you can download all the needed files here I also posted Putty.exe which the scirpts uses to SSH to the device. crate a folder in your downloads called UNIFI and copy all contents to it and it should work. for all other issues refeer to the code. 

There may be a few bugs, if you find some please feel free to message me and il try fix it as soon as I can 

!NOTE!
I Still have NOT yet finished the shell script for linux
