Shell Script to Configure Monitor Mode on Unifi-AP-AC-PRO 5ghz

Currently In working progress hope to finish soon. 
The script is designed to connect to the  
UNIFI AP AC Pro router via ssh and force it into monitor 
mode that will dump to your local Wireshark to be able to view the packets. 


UPDATE:

I have now rewrote the scirpt in Batch as a .bat file, you can download the Rar file it also contains Putty.exe which the scirpts uses to SSH to the device.
